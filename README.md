**pyqx** is brought to you assuming that you will use a graphics tablet to draw. Fear not if you don't have one, for the shortcuts and controls are well designed to be confortable while using the mouse too. The most comfortable way to use pyqx is by having one hand on the keyboard and the other on the mouse/pen at every moment. You won't have to move your fingers around every time you want to change the tool: we've already thinked about that.
