**pyqx** is made assuming that you will use a graphics tablet to draw. Fear not if you don't have one, for the shortcuts and controls are well designed to be confortable while using the mouse too. You will only need to have one hand on the keyboard at every moment but you won't have to move your fingers around every time you want to change the tool. We've already thinked about that.
